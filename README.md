# HANGMAN INSTRUCTIONS
Guess the letters in the secret word to solve the puzzle. You can guess a letter by typing it on your keyboard. If you solve the word, you win! Be careful! You can only make 6 mistakes...

## HANGMAN TIPS & STRATEGIES
Use your vowels. Looking at vowels is a good way to start. Since there are only 5, you can fill in some blanks pretty quickly. They can even help you guess the answer straight away. For example, if you try the letter 'a' and the word looks like this '_a_a_a', you might be able to guess straight away that the answer is banana just from one letter.

Etaoin shrdlu. "etaoin shrdlu" is two words listing the most commonly used letters in the English language, in order of frequency. 'e' is the most commonly used letter, '◊ê' is second-most common, etc. After trying your vowels, try out a few letters from this list to see if they appear in the word!

Break down phrases. When trying to guess a phrase, break it up and look at each word rather than focus on the letters. If you can guess just one word then it may lead you to the other words in the saying. You can also use the tip at the top of the window for extra help.
