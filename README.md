Etaoin shrdlu. "Etaoin shrdlu" is two words listing the most commonly used letters in the English language, in order of frequency. "E" is the most commonly used letter, "t" is second-most common, etc. After trying your vowels, try out a few letters from this list to see if they appear in the word!

Break down phrases. When trying to guess a phrase, break it up and look at each word rather than focus on the letters. If you can guess just one word then it may lead you to the other words in the saying. You can also use the tip at the top of the window for extra help.
